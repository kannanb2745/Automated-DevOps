Improvement Suggestions:

1. Organize by File Type: There are various types of files in the project. It would be beneficial to organize these files by type into specific folders. For example, all .log files could be placed in a logs folder, all .py files in a python folder, etc.

2. Remove Unnecessary Files: There are several files with no extension (no_ext: 95). These files should be reviewed to determine if they are necessary for the project. If not, they should be removed to reduce clutter.

3. Consolidate Similar Files: There are multiple log files in the logs folder. If these are not being used for historical purposes, consider consolidating these into a single log file to reduce the number of files in the project.

4. Remove Temporary Files: The .DS_Store files are created by Mac OS X and are not necessary for the project. These can be removed and added to the .gitignore file to prevent them from being added to the project in the future.

5. Better Use of .gitignore: There are some files and directories (like .DS_Store, venv/, __pycache__/ etc.) which are not supposed to be part of the repository as they are user/system-specific or they are generated when the code is run. These can be mentioned in .gitignore so that they are not tracked by git.

6. Documentation: It seems like there are only 3 .md files. If these are the only documentation files, consider adding more documentation to the project. This will help other developers understand the project more easily.

7. Use of Virtual Environment: It seems like the virtual environment (venv) is part of the project directory. Usually, it's a good practice to keep it outside the project directory to avoid pushing it to the version control system. 

8. File Naming: Some files have unusual extensions like .1, .12, .typed. It's recommended to use standard and descriptive file extensions to indicate the type and purpose of the file.

9. Directory Structure: The directory structure seems to be very flat. It's recommended to organize the files in a hierarchical manner based on their functionalities.
