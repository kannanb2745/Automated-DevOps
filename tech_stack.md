The tech stack of this project appears to be Python, as indicated by the presence of .py files and Python-related directories such as venv (which stands for virtual environment, a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects separate). 

The project also seems to be using several Python libraries, including dns, _pytest, tqdm, loguru, and requests, as indicated by the directories under venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/. 

The presence of .log files suggests that the application includes logging, and the .env file indicates that environment variables are being used. 

The .md files indicate that Markdown is used, likely for documentation. The .gitignore file suggests that Git is being used for version control. 

The .sh, .ps1, .csh, and .fish files indicate the use of various shell scripts, which are often used for automating tasks. 

The .cfg file is typically a configuration file, which can be used by various programs to set initial settings. The .test file suggests some form of testing is being implemented. 

The .pyc files are compiled Python files, which are generated and used by Python internally. The .pyi file is a Python interface file, often used for type checking. 

The presence of .DS_Store files suggest that this project is being worked on a macOS system, as these are hidden files created by the Mac OS X operating system for storing custom attributes of a folder. 

Please note that without more specific information about the content of these files and directories, this is a general observation and the actual tech stack might include more technologies.
