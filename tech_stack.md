The project appears to be using the following tech stack:

1. Python: The presence of .py files indicates that Python is the main programming language used in this project. The project also includes .pyc (Python compiled file) and .pyi (Python stub file) files.

2. Virtual Environment (venv): The venv folder suggests that the project is using a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.

3. Libraries: The project uses several Python libraries including dns, _pytest, tqdm, loguru, requests, and idna among others. These are located in the venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/ directory, indicating that they are installed in the project's virtual environment.

4. Shell Scripts: The presence of .sh, .ps1, .fish, and .csh files suggest that the project might be using shell scripts for task automation or system management.
