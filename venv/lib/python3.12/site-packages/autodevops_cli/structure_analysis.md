Improvement Suggestions:

1. Organize Python files: All python files should be kept in a separate folder, let's say, 'src' or 'scripts' for better organization. This will make it easier to locate and manage all Python files.

2. Environment file: The '.env' file should be kept in a separate folder, such as 'config' or 'settings', to keep all configuration-related files in one place.

3. Log files: The 'logs' folder seems to be well-organized. However, it might be beneficial to further categorize them based on dates or functionality for easier access.

4. Compiled Python files: The '__pycache__' folder is where Python stores compiled bytecode files. This folder is usually not needed and can be added to .gitignore file to prevent it from being tracked by version control system.

5. Workflow file: The '.github/workflow/' folder should be renamed to '.github/workflows/' as per the standard GitHub Actions convention. Also, all workflow-related files should be kept in this folder.

6. Dockerfile: If there are other Docker-related files (like .dockerignore), consider creating a 'docker' directory.

7. Test files: If there are multiple test files, consider creating a 'tests' directory.

8. No extension files: Identify the purpose of 'no_ext' files. If they are configuration or script files, move them to appropriate directories or add suitable extensions.

9. Documentation: Consider adding a 'docs' directory for project documentation.

10. Root directory: The root directory should only contain readme, license, setup, and configuration files. All other files should be in their respective directories.

Remember, a well-organized project structure makes it easier for others to understand and contribute to the project.
